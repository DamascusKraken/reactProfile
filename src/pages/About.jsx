        <h3>
          Thank you for taking the time to review my coding portfolio. I'm a dedicated Full Stack Developer based in New Braunfels, Texas, 
          having made the move from California in 2019â€”a transition I found immensely rewarding. 
          At this point in my life, I'm focused on making tangible progress towards the future rather than merely planning for it. 
          I'm assuming that's the purpose of you reading this.
        </h3>

        <h3>
        I aim to concentrate on advancing my education to attain a bachelor's degree while concurrently gaining a deep understanding of the industry. 
        My goal is to pinpoint areas where I may be lacking so that I can strengthen those weaknesses and evolve into a well-rounded asset. 
        I'm enthusiastic about collaborating with others in diverse settings and am open to taking on leadership positions.
        This is the industry I want to work in so lets make it happen.
        </h3>

        <h3>
        In making the decision to leave Texas, a state deeply tied to my big family, I've found the choice to be immensely rewarding. Within my household, 
        I share my life with my wife, two children and a furry companion named Loki. During moments of leisure, 
        I actively seek out Dungeons and Dragons sessions or engage in board games with my kids.
        </h3>
